# Classification Projects

Welcome to the Classification Projects Repository! This repository houses various classification model projects, each focusing on predicting different outcomes using various datasets and features. These projects serve as practical examples for learning, experimenting, and applying classification techniques to real-world problems.

## Projects

### 1. Diabetes Detection
**Brief Description**: This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. Early detection of diabetes can help in managing the condition and preventing complications.

### 2. Potato Disease Detection
**Brief Description**: This project focuses on identifying diseases in potato plants using image data. By accurately detecting diseases, farmers can take timely actions to prevent crop loss and improve yield.

### 3. Real-Time Object Detection
**Brief Description**: This project involves detecting and classifying objects in real-time video streams. It has applications in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, enhancing safety and efficiency.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis
**Brief Description**: This project analyzes text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of reviews, social media posts, and other textual content. It helps businesses understand customer opinions and improve their products and services.

### 5. Fake News Detection
**Brief Description**: This project aims to identify fake news articles using natural language processing techniques. By detecting misinformation, it helps maintain the integrity of news and prevents the spread of false information.

### 6. Lung Cancer Detection
**Brief Description**: This project predicts the presence of lung cancer based on medical imaging data and patient history. Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates.

### 7. Pneumonia Detection
**Brief Description**: This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for timely treatment and preventing complications.

### 8. Stroke Prediction
**Brief Description**: This project predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on patient data such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status. Early prediction can help in preventive measures and better management of risk factors.
